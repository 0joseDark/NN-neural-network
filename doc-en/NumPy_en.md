The ** numpy ** is a powerful library for scientific computing in Python.It provides support for multidimensional arrays, high -performance mathematical functions, and tools to work with linear algebra, transformed from Fourier and random numbers.It is widely used in projects involving data analysis, machine learning, data science, among others.

Here is an index that can serve as a starting point to explore the numpy:
