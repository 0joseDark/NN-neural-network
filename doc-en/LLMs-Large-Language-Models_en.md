LLMS (Large Language Models) are large language models trained in huge amounts of textual data to understand, generate, and interpret human language.They are based on deep learning architectures such as transformer, which allows us to efficiently process text and capture contextual relationships between words, phrases and paragraphs.

### Main features of llms:
1. ** Size and capacity **:
- The models are called "large" due to the number of parameters, often in the billion or up to trillion.
- The more parameters, the more capacity the model has to learn complex patterns.

2. ** Training **:
- They are trained in vast data sets, which include books, articles, websites, and other publicly available texts.
- Training involves predicting the next word in a text sequence, allowing the model to learn linguistic structures and factual knowledge.

3. ** Versatility **:
- LLMS can perform a wide variety of tasks, such as:
- Answer questions.
- Translate texts.
- Summarize information.
- Write creative texts (articles, stories, poems).
- Generate programming code.

4. ** Popular examples **:
-** GPT (Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) **: OpenAi models like GPT-4 (what you are using now).
- ** Bert (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers) **: A Google model used for language understanding tasks.
- ** PALM, Llama, T5 **, and others developed by companies like Google, Goal and others.

5. ** Applications **:
- Chatbots and virtual assistants.
- Productivity tools, such as text editors and content generators.
- Feeling analysis and text classification.
- Education, technical support and even scientific research.

Despite their power, LLMS has limitations, such as training data bias, difficulty dealing with very specific or sensitive data, and the possibility of generating incorrect information or hallucinations (answers that seem plausible but are factually wrong).
