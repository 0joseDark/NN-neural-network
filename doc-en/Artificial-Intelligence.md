### What is Artificial Intelligence?

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is a branch of computer science focused on developing systems capable of performing tasks that, when carried out by humans, require intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, understanding natural language, and perception.

### Main Components of AI:
1. **Machine Learning (ML)**  
   - Involves algorithms that enable systems to learn and improve from experience without explicit programming. Examples include pattern recognition and outcome prediction.

2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
   - Allows machines to understand, interpret, and respond to human language. Examples include virtual assistants and automatic translators.

3. **Computer Vision**  
   - The ability to interpret and understand images or videos. Examples include facial recognition and medical image analysis.

4. **Expert Systems**  
   - Systems that simulate the knowledge and decision-making of human experts in specific areas.

5. **Robotics**  
   - The integration of AI with physical machines to perform tasks such as movement, manipulation, and interaction with the environment.

### Examples of AI Applications:
- **Virtual Assistants**: Google Assistant, Siri, Alexa.  
- **Healthcare**: Medical diagnostics and disease prediction.  
- **Industry**: Process automation and predictive maintenance.  
- **Transportation**: Autonomous vehicles.  
- **Entertainment**: Recommendations for movies, music, and games.

### Objectives of AI:
- Enable machines to solve complex problems.  
- Enhance human efficiency across various domains.  
- Create systems that operate autonomously and adaptively.
