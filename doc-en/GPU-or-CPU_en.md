** RETRIEVERVER-AUGMENTED GENERATOR (RAG) ** Basic CPU that uses the CPU, ideal for running on a Windows 10. We will use popular libraries such as `Langchain` and` transformers`.The process will be divided into stages with comments and explanations for each part.

The system will have two main parts:
1. ** Indexation: ** We created a text document index.
2. ** Search and generation: ** The system recovers relevant excerpts from the index and generates a response combining search and generation.

Follow the step by step:

### Python Code for Rag
`` `python
# Import necessary libraries
From langchain.vectors import faiss
From Langchain.emBedDings Import HuggingFacembeddings
From Langchain.Chains Import Retievalqa
From Transformers Import Pipeline
From langchain.llms import huggingfacepipeline
import the

# Step 1: Initial Configuration
# Make sure you have the libraries installed: Langchain, Transformers, Faiss
# Use `Pip Install Langchain Transformers Faiss-Cpu`

# Step 2: Configure the documents
# Create a list of documents to index.These documents can be simple texts.
Documents = [
"Python is a high level programming language.",
"Windows 10 is a popular operating system.",
"Artificial intelligence is the future of technology."
]

# Step 3: Create embeddings for documents
# We use Huggingface's minilm embedding model to turn text into vectors.
Print ("Creating Embeddings ...")
embedding_model = huggingfacembeddings (model_name = "sentence-transformers/all-minilm-l6-v2")

# Step 4: Create the index using faiss
# Faiss is a quick library for vector search.
Print ("Creating Faiss Index ...")
vectorstore = faiss.from_texts (documents, embedding_model)

# Step 5: Configure the Answer Generator (LLM)
# We use Huggingface's `Distilgpt2 'language model to generate answers.
print ("Configuring the Answer Generator ...")
Generator_Pipeline = pipeline ("text-genetation", model = "distilgpt2", device = -1) # device = -1 uses CPU
llm = huggingfacepipeline (pipeline = generator_pipeline)

# Step 6: Configure Pipeline Rag
# We connect the generator (LLM) to the index via the pipeline rag.
Print ("Setting Pipeline Rag ...")
retriever = vectorsstore.as_retiever ()
rag_chain = retrievalqa (llm = llm, retriever = retriever)

# Step 7: Test the Rag System
# We ask the system to answer questions based on indexed documents.
Print ("Ready. Ask questions!")
While True:
Query = Input ("\ ndigitis your question (or 'out' to end):")
if query.lower () == "leave":
Print ("Closing the system. See you more!")
break
Response = rag_chain.run (query)
Print (F "Answer: {Response}")

### Code Explanation

1. ** Initial configuration: **
We install the necessary libraries (`langchain`,` transformers`, `faiss`) and imported the modules.

2. ** Document preparation: **
The `documents` list contains the texts that will be indexed.These documents can be adapted to any theme.

3. ** Embeddings: **
We use the `Sentence-Transformers/All-Minilm-L6-V2`

4. ** Indexation with Faiss: **
FAISS creates an efficient index for vector search, allowing you to find relevant documents quickly.

5. ** Generator (LLM): **
We configure the Huggingface's `Distilgpt2` model to generate answers.It runs in the CPU (`device = -1`).

6. ** Pipeline Rag: **
We combine the FAISS (Retriever) index and the Language Generator (LLM) using the Langchain pipeline.

7. ** Interaction: **
The system accepts user questions at the terminal, recovers relevant index information and uses LLM to generate answers.

### IMPORTANT NOTES
- ** Performance: ** CPU use is sufficient for basic tests.For large data volumes, consider using a GPU.
- ** Personalized documents: ** Replace the list of documents with your texts.
- ** Installation: ** Make sure all modules are installed before running the script.
